# A philosophy named Coloniume
Today, we are at a point in the history of human life where in accessing to universal Internet, information technology is considered a necessity of any society because its use is one of the most important and necessary indicators in the development of societies. Advanced information and communication technologies make it possible to access vast sources of information. In other words, today this amount of accessing to information and communication technology and the way of using them is an important factor in the development of societies in all scientific, economic, political and even cultural dimensions.

According to our beliefs and confirmed theories, the enhancement of the educational, economic, health and medical services and other fields of activity in the current era is directly and inherently related to the expansion and development of the World Wide Web, As the Internet by eliminating geographical, national and ethnic borders, plays a very important and fundamental role in the flourishing of industry, trade and economy of countries, The vital role and effect of communication and the breadth of the communication platform in the national, transnational and global spheres has made the Internet one of the most important political, social and economic tools in human history, as this miracle of the century has made the evolution and convergence of cultures and has brought civilizations closer to each other. Today, information technology with the help of communication technology has become pervasive and has changed the world. The development of computer communication and technology has accelerated in line with the convergence and unification of these two dynamic and energetic processes, and the information society is the result of this cooperation.

Considerable problems are the barriers to the development and unfair distribution of the network worldwide, where some countries have received a fair share of the Internet while others have limited access to the Internet. On the other hand, in a broader study, this fact is clear that even in one country, the amount of Internet access is not equal for individuals and the economic power of individuals (natural or legal) determines the amount, quality and quantity of Internet access. In the meantime, one of the major challenges to realize the information society is bridging the digital divide. The digital divide represents inequalities in accessing to information and communication technologies. The concept of the digital divide states that in the new world, the use of communication and information technologies is not fairly divided between different countries as well as within societies. The main factor in creating this gap is unequal and unlimited access to the Internet. Therefore, the issue of accessing to an efficient, secure and accessible internet platform has become a serious and new challenge because censorship, restriction of network traffic, monopoly and regional control based on the general interests and policies of governments and ruling systems are common problems, which has been created by some governments. While the "right of using free Internet" and free flow of information is one of the basic legal principles and the inalienable right of every person in today's world because the Internet undoubtedly plays an important role in ensuring the right to freedom of expression, and access to information technology and communication is becoming an essential condition for nations' ability to have many rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

## What is Coloniume?
After what has been said above, the general purpose of Coloniume can be inferred to some extent. In a simple and general way, we intend to create a new concept of a global network that meets the needs of people around the world to access the free Internet. This chain network will be exclusive, free, extensive and powerful, which will make every effort to reduce the digital divide in the world, and in a way, it will be a big step toward the promotion of science, culture, economy, hygiene and health and other aspects of human life around the world based on the principles of justice and freedom of access to the Internet.

Our ultimate goal and effort to create a massive, free Coloniume network is summarized in the following structure:

U + Me = “Coloniume”

You and I conjoin and build a huge free, cohesive, global colony that meets the interests and demands of each of us.

A completely free, decentralized, and government-independent communication network that will be implemented, developed, and expanded by individuals, organizations, and independent non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The main purpose of launching this network is creating and expanding a kind of completely free, secure, non-governmental and independent communication platform of the existing communication networks, so that it can be censored, restricted and influenced, and at the same time to make it impossible to disable communication and interaction with all communication networks and Internet. In a general perspective, after its development and expansion, the coloniume will help the internet so that in case of network disconnection in any area covered by coloniume and without geographical and political restrictions, it will be possible to exchange information and data locally. And each of the nodes will be able to connect to the Internet and act as a bridge between the local network and the Internet.

This is especially important in the Internet of Things (IoT) sector in critical sectors, especially in hospitals and centers affiliated with the medical and emergency network, where the Internet disconnections can be irreparable and costly at any moment.

To upgrade and accelerate the expansion of the network, standard communication hardware will be used. By providing services, the owners of these hardware will be able to receive rewards, the amount of which will be determined in proportion to the services provided and the total service which is described below.

In the coloniume network, the cost of the Internet is completely free for users. In this way, each person will be able to build their own communication network using their mobile phone or standard network equipment. By sharing free internet with Wi-Fi to others, these people will not only contribute to the continuity of the Internet connection, but by receiving rewards, they will also be part of the coloniume network.<br><br>
![Coloniume Network Map 1](images/001.jpg?raw=true "Coloniume Network Map 1")
## Coloniume network capabilities
In general, considering the unique capabilities of the Coloniume network, some of the following features can be enumerated:

1. Ability to set up an independent free local and global communication network after launching the second generation nodes (LINKER NODES)
2. Ability to connect to the World Wide Web
3. Independent Blockchain network to provide secure and unlimited services
4. Creating special platforms and decentralized, uncensored and unrestricted social networks
5. A super safe messenger that users' information will be exchanged Peer to peer without SNIF storage. It will be the World Wide Web and will be very efficient for free communication in times of crisis and emergency.
6. Creating a suitable space for processors and storage servers and clients
7. Building a Coloniume PC and connect to memory and distributed processor so that each person will be able to benefit from distributed storage and processing services in the cheapest way.

Coloniume PCs, or Coloniume computers, will be a revolutionary generation of super-cheap computers that lacks processor or storage space and will meet all of their needs from shared resources on the Coloniume network through which network members with sharing rest time for their advanced systems can make money, and people who cannot afford the hardware with the lowest cost can enhance the capability of processing and storage.

Coloniume is environmentalist. The network tries to use all the resources economically. To open the blockchain blocks, hardware or so-called Coloniume miners will not do any useless operations or attempts and there will be no redundant processing.

## Implementation steps and network objectives:
### Statement of the problem:

Considering that the Internet is not only the main infrastructure of development, but also the world today is integrating and converging scientifically and culturally through the Internet, regardless of geographical, climatic and racial dimensions. And so the Internet helps to reduce the various inequalities, provided that access to the Internet itself not to be unequal. Information and communication technology as a powerful tool has affected the economic, social, cultural and political affairs of most countries of the world. The gap between countries that use this technology as a focal point for the development of their national programs and countries that do not use this phenomenon properly is widening sharply.

The study of the available statistics and information of countries in this field, confirms the fact in this regard and to expand the dimensions of Internet access at the public level and to minimize the digital divide caused by the lack of or weakness of the Internet in parts of the world that are deprived of Internet services or have poor and unacceptable access to Internet network services. The Coloniume team identifies the following issues that are common and global and includes all people around the world, and as its ultimate goal tries to solve or minimize the complications and consequences resulted from these issues, these issues include:

- Global quarantine and dependence on Internet service
- High cost of Internet supply
- Lack of proper internet coverage in all places
- Lack of Internet with acceptable quality of authenticity in some countries or regions
- Increasing costs of using personal computers
- High power consumption and high consumption of personal computers
- Information censorship and forms of free flow of information globally
- Lack of public access to Internet services

The following is a brief explanation of each of the above mentioned issues and problems to show their importance and role in the lives of all human beings and societies:

### Global quarantine and dependence on Internet services
Covid 19 a pandemic disease had heavy fatalities, financial and emotional effects, an unknown disease that swept across the world regardless of physical and geographical boundaries, and what came to the aid of humanity at this dangerous time was undoubtedly the Internet and digital technology. In the shadow of the Internet, the possibility of universal use of information and exchange of scientific and technical information in the prevention and control of this disease was emerged quickly. The significance of the Internet in the era of quarantine was in a way that can be named as humans' redemptive factor in this era. Because in the shadow of the Internet, the medical staff provided comprehensive and complete information about the disease to the people of the world, regardless of their specific geography, in order to train and implement prevention methods. Recognizing the early signs of the disease with the training provided on the Internet has saved the lives of millions of people. Regardless of the effective role of the Internet in the health sector, its impact on other important and vital parts of the world during the quarantine period is very significant and commendable, as its effective role of the Internet in education and learning. Because by using the ability to communicate in long-distances, virtual classes from elementary to academic levels were able to go on with the Internet, and this step was very effective and efficient.

### High cost of internet supply
Regarding the significance of the Internet in public education from the most basic level of university and also its very effective role in the economy, especially microeconomics and at the level of small local businesses that are the lifeline and Livelihood of many families, the importance of cheap Internet access or free and available is very clear and obvious. since the scientific, educational and economic life of many sections of the world is dependent on and completely connected to the Internet, while providing the Internet in the current situation is very difficult for many people, especially students and housewives and small businesses. It is sometimes inaccessible, which in turn will make social and economic divisions in the world and will increase the existing social gap. On the other hand, in developing countries, due to the lack of national infrastructure, telecommunications and the lack of economic prosperity, the development of the Internet is much more expensive and costly than developed countries, so the Coloniume Foundation is aware of this problem and the need to solve it considers it as one of its greatest challenges and missions and hopes for a day that the Internet is available for free at the same speed and quality as it is available in the most advanced countries of the world, in the most remote deprived village, on such a day, Coloniume will be proud of fulfilling this great mission.

### General inappropriate internet coverage
Countries' various social, economic and cultural conditions and inappropriate and imbalanced enjoyment in metropolises and suburban cities and places deprived of civil, social and cultural distribution in budgets provide different income levels of subcultures within a country. See that some are equipped with appropriate facilities, including access to up-to-date information. and in contrast, some people, despite having sufficient qualifications and talents because of the lack of financial and educational facilities, do not have hardware and software facilities. This issue will automatically deepen and spread social inequalities in countries and among citizens.

### Lack of Internet with acceptable quality of authenticity in some countries or regions
If we consider the quantitative development of the Internet and the ways of using it as one of the important indicators of moving towards the information society, the different conditions of different countries and individuals as a citizen in each country will exacerbate social inequalities, If we accept the reason that in the current era power and wealth are in wisdom, the wisdom is more synonymous with having extensive information in various fields of analyzing data, unbalanced conditions and limitations in accessing to information for countries around the world and individuals within the countries as a citizen, lead to the spread of social inequalities at the international and national levels. At the international level, it must be said that, in developing countries, due to the lack of national infrastructure, telecommunications and the lack of economic prosperity, the development of the Internet is much more expensive and costly than developed countries. Second, these countries also face more fundamental problems such as malnutrition, road communication, employment, war, and unstable political systems. There is no budget for the high cost of computer equipment, and such facilities are only economically available to the upper and independent classes. Thirdly, in these countries, this technology is monopolized by government centers and the government is in charge of data communication lines, so the impossibility of competition due to this aspect causes a sharp decline in the quality of Internet services. In addition to what mentioned above, because the information in the Internet network is provided in English the lack of knowledge of this language is not considered as the impossibility of accessing to data. Introspection in the above cases indicates a kind of quantitative and qualitative imbalance in the use of the achievements of the information society in different countries, especially in the north and south. The existence of these conditions themselves exacerbates social inequalities in countries around the world. If with fair access to the Internet at the world level this inequality is not eliminated and reduced, it will lead to inequality in more countries. Coloniume strives to create a secure, free and quality platform from the efficient, uncensored and free internet for all parts of the world because, in addition to all the advantages mentioned above, virtual networks are the best and in some cases the only media to hear and reflect the voice of justice and freedom of many oppressed people in the world.<br><br>
![Quality factor](images/002.jpg?raw=true "Quality factor")

### Increasing costs of using personal computers
Until now, the general public could not afford to buy high-end pieces, but now, with the sharp rise in the price of pieces, even the supply of low-end systems has become unavailable to the general public. The issue of expensive computer pieces has complicated matters as the school reopening season begins. Because schools have resorted to online and distance education to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, families are forced to provide computer and laptop equipment for their children to continue their education. On the other hand, the dependence of Telecommuting jobs and internet businesses, this increase in demand along with the increase in the price of pieces, has doubled the problems in this area and it seems that there is no solution and no prospects to solve these problems in the short term. This is one of the issues that the Coloniume team will try to solve on a global scale.

### High power consumption and high consumption of personal computers
In the current world where the use of technology in offices and organizations is increasingly developing, energy consumption by various devices is also increasing. Today, one of the most important factors in increasing the consumption of electricity in offices are computers and their accessories such as monitors, scanners and printers, so that their total consumption in office often exceeds even the consumption of lighting. One study found that systems and their accessories accounted for about 8 percent of total household electricity consumption, and 25 percent more were used by other consumable electronics. The report also shows that computers use much more energy than laptops, which is almost six times as much energy because laptops are optimized for battery life in a way that they are not personal computers. However, the need to conserve energy reserves as well as reduce environmental pollutants has led to the implementation of energy management programs within the framework of a comprehensive law or a set of programs and laws and regulations in different countries of the world. It has been implemented that in these programs, rational and optimal use of energy and reduction of energy demand in comparison with economic growth and improvement of technology and efficiency of equipment and prevention of environmental pollution and provision of necessary facilities have been among the goals that are sometimes quantitatively raised.

### Information and forms of free flow of information at the global level
Regarding the issue that freedom of information is the spirit of democracy, and practically without the freedom of information, society cannot claim democracy. The free flow of information or freedom of information has received a lot of attention in recent years because the right to access information and the free flow of information is a cornerstone and a fundamental principle of democracy. The growing and astonishing expansion of mass media in the world and the chance to access the latest news and written and audio and video reports from the farthest regions of the world and the optimal use of media and super media and in fact new Internet-based communication technologies in the world, the idea called Global Village have made the world a reality, and we are now living in a world where people are sharp-sighted of each other. Possibly the term "global aquarium" or "glass world" is the innate of this idea, and it is in this glass world that due to the power of the Internet, the voice of trial and oppression of a person from the most remote villages of deprived areas can be heard by people around the world. This powerful communication like a lever can prevent many silent and hidden injustices On the other hand, access to information accelerates the process of innovation and initiative in society, and identifies talents and makes them grow and develop. The Coloniume Foundation by virtue of this power of Internet technology seeks to make the injustice in the world as little and weaker as possible and have free access to the free flow of information over the Internet around the world.

### Lack of public access to Internet services
The significance of developing Internet access to developing countries has been acknowledged by governments and international organizations, as well as by communications and development experts. The view of the vast majority is that the Internet and related telecommunications technologies should be considered as a national, strategic infrastructure. Establishing such a strategic infrastructure seems vital for developing countries. So that communication can improve economic productivity, governance, education, health and quality of life, especially in marginalized areas. These results show that wider associations within developing countries will improve the general information infrastructure in these countries; as a result, it creates positive changes in political-economic improvement. Consequently, lack of public access to Internet services can lead to lag or development of countries at the international level proportion to the lack of useful or efficient access to the Internet where billions of people still lack the benefits of Internet access. People connected to the World Wide Web can work from home, gain information and learning tools, and grow their business. They can also be more cooperative in the workplace, to communicate with their loved ones in long distances, and to better protect themselves in emergencies. When countries invest in Internet access for the people, both sides benefit it. understanding this issue Coloniume tries to address this shortcoming, so that anyone anywhere in the world can access the Internet safely, cheaply, or freely.

## Advantages of launching a Coloniume network
After a comprehensive discussion of Internet-related issues that are the main goal of the Coloniume team, we now turn to the benefits of launching a Coloniume network, which are summarized below. Considering that Coloniume Foundation follows higher goals in evolving the humanitarian and benevolent goals, and the following goals have been mentioned only as the basic goals of Coloniume:

- Free flow of information
- Free internet access for everyone
- Improving the quality of life
- Expanding Internet businesses
- The prosperity of the Internet economy
- Free public education
- Industrial prosperity
- Launching a local network for that communication in emergencies and crises
- Reducing the energy consumption of personal computers by entering PCs into the market
- Public access to much cheaper computers than personal computers with very high security

We will now give a brief explanation of each of these issues:

### Free flow of information
With the advent of the Internet, the free flow of information has exceeded many national walls, as well as rapid advances in mobile phones, but it must be said that this speed of unity within a group of countries was not in line with the global arena. However, this synchronicity, despite the various challenge, could be used to eliminate some issues and gaps of ethnic, religious, gender and origin.

At the national level, information flows are directly affected by government policies and valuations. According to some theories, the nature of information is based on its dissemination and flow in human societies. For this reason, and since there have always been obstacles and restrictions to the existence of freedom of expression, and also because freedom of expression is the basis and root of freedom of information, the same obstacles that prevent the realization of freedom of expression appears as the path to freedom of information and prevents information from being sent or received. Such restrictions, imposed by non-democratic political systems and due to the separation of powers and citizens, will impede national development and prosperity, so Coloniume intends to expand the safe, accessible and public Internet and provide free transfer of information internationally.<br><br>
![Coloniume Network Map](images/003.jpg?raw=true "Coloniume Network Map")

### Free internet access for everyone
Certainly, this is a dream that has been on the human mind for many years, since the Internet has played its role in advancing the ideals of social, economic, medical and public health, education and the creation of welfare issues and facilities in other fields. Many efforts have been made to spread the Internet internationally, but the vast majority of them have been for Utilitarian and profiteering motives. Coloniume is a constitution that will try to expand and develop a safe, public and free internet according to the needs of every human being, of every ethnicity, race and in every geography of the planet. This is one of the most important and the most fundamental goals of the Coloniume will be done during its course and effort.

### Improvement of the life quality
The world today is rapidly becoming an information society. A society in which knowledge and the rate of access and useful use of knowledge have a key and crucial role. The information society could not have been designed without scientific and technological advances, especially in the field of information and communication. Since algebra prevails in scientific and technical processes and developments, it can be concluded that the realization of the information society is an algebra. Of course, this process is costly for some societies, and for other societies, instead of creating costs, it becomes a factor in achieving development goals, in fact, it itself becomes a development factor. One of the most important issues of globalization and expanding reality is the scope of application and effects of information in different dimensions of present and future life of human societies that its various dimensions have involved all countries of the world in some way. In this respect, the alteration of approach from productive technology to information technology has initiated a new stage of human social life; in a way, the widespread use of information and communication technologies has led to the realization of a new form of society, called the "information society". A society in which knowledge is the worthy and, therefore, it is capital that serves manpower, and not vice versa. Epistemological-human development and the growth of individual capabilities are the driving force of these information societies. In such societies, citizens are moved from the paradigm of life to survival, to the paradigm of life for growth and this is in fact the ultimate goal of technology and all the inventions that have emerged to date. Therefore, referring to this capability, i.e trying for growth and excellence, instead of trying to live by relying on the power of the pervasive Internet and technology based on it, Coloniume has considered a developed world with social and economic justice as the main goal of its goals.

### Expanding Internet businesses
In today's digital world, digital business is the most effective way to make macro revenues and reach the pinnacle of success, because the digital revolution has taken place on a global scale and Internet technology has changed our way we of working, living, playing and learning. The influence and universality of the Internet has enabled us to do most of the work better and faster. The digital revolution has the potential to change markets faster than any other force in history and in this case, organizations that do not have planning to move toward digital career developments will undoubtedly experience a kind of lagging, and those that have joined the digitalization process will experience new revenue streams and unprecedented business development. Today, almost all markets and industrial sectors are passing by the information age to the digital age, and the pace of change is faster than ever. All countries, cities and companies have come to understand that in order to survive and prosper in this new era, they must evolve. This shift to the digital age requires far-reaching changes in technology, organizational management, culture, and beyond of it. To enter the field of competition and survival, organizations must be brave and courageous.

Now more than ever, organizations in pursuit of their goals, need to seize the opportunities for digitalization.

Speeding up the process of digitalization and upgrading, critical infrastructure, increasing Gross domestic product of countries, reducing costs and creating jobs will enable new and diverse groups of resourceful entrepreneurs to create new jobs around the world. This, in turn, provides more access and opportunities for the training of technology-based professions to enthusiasts around the world, and the result is nothing more than lessening the gap between the development of countries and increasing the level of competition among them. Therefore, having a proper digital ecosystem will be necessary to achieve each of these. Therefore, having a proper digital ecosystem will be necessary to achieve each of these. And this

ecosystem is the one that Coloniume tries with all its might and energy to provide it for all the people of the world. In this regard, and to achieve such a sublime and great goal, Coloniume with the contribution of individual those who care about their own destiny and that of their fellow human beings. the blue angels of Coloniume, the saviors of the spread of the free, universal, and secure Internet whose performance will be given a full definition in the future.

### Internet Expansion
In the era of communication, by appealing to the power of the Internet to remove physical and geographical boundaries regardless of race, religion and ethnicity, we can see the impact of Internet technology on individuals' self-actualization. In an environment where humans freely interact with each other, these interactions, thoughts and visualizations are digitized and thus will be visible to the internet community. On the other hand, as it is expanded by the imagination of other like-minded people, it is used by any other Internet user, integrated with other mental products, and become global. This is because of the global exchange of thoughts and free ideas. The metaphor of the shared brain is one of the strongest metaphors in the world, because it promising in the transformation of one's self-awareness and self-knowledge into a glorious and unique global innovation. People cooperate because so far the result of their collective effort has been more than their individual abilities, and their cooperation with others will lead to amazing results. From the perspective of postmodernism and relativism, data reveals passion, accuracy, temperament, ideology, and spirituality. If we look at it from a realistic perspective, we all know that at the end everything becomes a whole, which our Eager selves makes the whole as a part of us. A creature, a masterpiece that makes the world exist. Internet technology helps us engage in self-reflective communication, and build the self based on our perceptions of ourselves. It is the conscious and transcendent human being who with the complete study and purposeful awareness regains his role and identity in the world. The temporal and spatial limitations of any human being will not be able to withstand the free and transcendent thought, and modern man by relying on power of internet connection will be able to show the real self to the whole world. It is this principle that motivates the Coloniume to find and exalt the lost creations of deprivation and poverty in the world and grant the Internet to the poorest and most remote parts of the world.

### Free public education
In line with virtualization of life, classes and discussions are also held online because governments have come to the conclusion that using cyberspace is the only and best option for managing the affairs of the country and the lives of the people. Therefore, in all fields, efforts are being made to institutionalize the virtual lifestyle in communities, as during the Corona epidemic the experience of online and Internet-based classes has shown that considering the provision students' needs in cyberspace Compared to other educational fields, the resources and infrastructure necessary to provide life and education in cyberspace are usually provided to the maximum for this group. Therefore, considering justice in resources, we can notice the justice in the field of cyberspace, ie the quality of online classes. In other words, there are two important ways to establish equality in society: The Internet and the education. By combining the two, e-learning will be the greatest factor in achieving equality in the present century. By removing barriers related to time, place and socio-economic status, individuals can take responsibility for their lifelong learning. The educational discourse on the Internet is different from the educational discourse in traditional methods because it is dynamic and interactive. The quantity and quality of education on the Internet is also different from the quantity and quality of the traditional education system. The interactivity of the Internet makes one more involved in managing one's information. In addition, Internet synchronization allows a student to store or visit information whenever they want. The Internet information and education explorer no longer has a time and place limit on information search and learning. The Internet provides a wide range of information and education for countless people easily and quickly, so that everyone can use the best professors and the best scientific and educational resources in any place and whenever they want. And this can only be done by relying on the miracle of the Internet , and this is the path that Coloniume seeks to create and revitalize for people around the world of all ages, classes and races who are keen to learn and to educate.

### Industrial prosperity
At the beginning of the 21st century, the fourth generation of the Industrial Revolution marked a turning point. The Fourth Industrial Revolution, or in other words, the digitalization of industry, will shape the future of industry, thanks to the benefits of information and communication technology in the present age.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution is based on the combination and integration of different technologies, and its implementation requires extensive soft changes in organizations and industries and technological cooperation between companies and countries with technology. Therefore, in a situation where methods of technology transfer, will be very difficult to keep up with the rapid pace of change when learning and collaboration are limited. as in recent years, the late development of infrastructure such as transportation and heavy industry delayed countries' industrialization process, the lack of developing infrastructures for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, such as the extensive, efficient, powerful Internet and flexible manufacturing, artificial intelligence and powerful manpower, will be lagged of the fourth developments of the Industrial Revolution. In fact, the use of technologies from the Fourth Industrial Revolution "agile approach to change and accountability", "technological ecosystem", "reception of digitalization and industrial automation", "attention to the Internet of Things", "advanced and predictive analysis" and Virtual and augmented reality will be the key to success in any industry from big, heavy and old industries such as oil and steel industry to industries such as insurance industry and tourism industry and even music industry or art and cinema, where future survival and excellence of them depend on the Internet and its technologies. Therefore, Coloniume will try to protect and sustain the life and foundations of the world industry with a round-the-clock and continuous effort that will be done with the help of the people of the world. The Internet will be secure, powerful and continuous, the infrastructure and the vital pulse of the world's industry in all kinds and dimensions.

### Implementation a local network for emergency communication and crises
The Coloniume Foundation's efforts to create and sustain an established and efficient Internet around the world will require to find a solution for times of crisis and regional and occasional Internet disconnection around the globe. In such conditions, by means of communication equipment and in the most accessible and possible ways, Coloniume will be connected to the Internet and will repair the local and regional disconnection and immediately will establish an Internet connection , and in the time lack of communication to the World Wide Web for any reason, the Independent people in the areas that are covered by coloniume will be able to exchange information for free and completely within the network and this is the power and inclusiveness in loyalty and commitment to the goals we've listed before, so that all over the world have fair, equitable, and consistent access to the Internet in a same level and with a minimal digital divide.

In Coloniume, any mobile phone or any computer can act as a server node and provide a platform by which CDAN network software is installed on computers and mobile phones so that service providers can provide communication services, sharing of internet and internal network resources and receive rewards through this.
## To receive rewards
Network service providers for providing specified services will receive rewards and fees in the form of digital currency which is specific C.D.A.N network.

Each node is rewarded when the device is connected to the network and is being serviced in any form of Internet sharing, processing power sharing or storage space. (The way of rewarding has a direct relationship with the volume of data exchanged through the device, pulses received from distributed servers, network connection time, etc.).

1 Colonix = 100.000.000 Clone

### The components of Coloniume network
1. Software for Android and IOS phones to turn phones into a Coloniume network server
2. Software under Linux and Windows to convert any personal computer to a Coloniume network server
3. Linker Node: standard communication devices for connecting and sharing the Internet
4. CPU Server and Data Storage server for sharing storage space and processing power

Linker Node: A device that has the ability to send and receive data through WIFI and is able to connect to the Internet through various channels and even the Starlink satellite network and to share it. More information and details will be provided in the future White Paper updates.

In addition, the device will be able to find similar servers around it to do networking task and also provide a platform for information to be passes securely and encrypted, in case of internet disconnection it also has this ability to automatically connect to the Coloniume network and repair the disconnection.

### Earning money by providing services:
- A - By installing special software to connect to the Coloniume network and login to the user account, converting the mobile phone into a server node for the Coloniume network to share the Internet through Hotspot technology. In the first phase, before launching the main network, all nodes will be connected via the Internet, and based on the progress of the Coloniume network expansion, the second phase will connect nodes and network servers and service providers and all network-related hardware to the Coloniume. At first, network software will only do the work of sharing the Internet, then they provide more services, such as sharing the storage memory within the phone or computer or special storage servers, and then the service of sharing will be able to process the CPU. After selecting the sharing rate, the volume of internal space or CPU processing power will be reserved and can only be used for the Coloniume network. Based on users' accurate calculation methods, Colonium token rewards will be awarded to services provided.
- B - By installing Coloniume software on PC version of Linux-Windows-Mac In this method, and after providing a network communication hardware such as Wi-Fi modem by sharing the Internet via Wi-Fi a person can receive a reward through her personal computer.
- C - By providing modems compatible with the Coloniume network or by updating the internal firmware of existing modems and sharing the Internet with others

## The universal challenge of expanding free internet in deprived areas
## Hot Point
A feature of the Coloniume Network function that allows residents of different parts of the world that by marking and locating of less developed areas on the map, increase the reward ratio of the network in those areas and get the attention of the Blue Angels or the developers of the Coloniume Network.

Accordingly, in order to get more rewards, investors will migrate to these areas and will help the expansion of the Internet in those areas by developing communication infrastructure and setting up telecommunications equipment and free Internet distribution.

To do so you only log in to the Coloniume website and mark that area as HOT POINT by locating the less developed areas on the map!

## Proof of power resource sharing (POPRS)
In this network, four coefficients are effective on reward.

1. Quality factor
This coefficient decreases with the increasing of jitter and ping compared to its averages. In other words, the better and more desirable the quality of the Internet in an area, the lower the coefficient will be, ie the quality factor has inverse ratio with jitter and ping. The less jitter and ping the high quality factor and as a result, the amount of reward received from the coloniume network will be higher.
This causes ISPs to try to increase the quality of the Internet quality into scale and average, and as a result, this process will improve the quality of the network over time.<br><br>

2. Hotpoint coefficient
This coefficient varies based on the amount of tags between 1 and 1.5. Thus, the most places that are tagged on the Coloniume website will have a coefficient of 1.5 and in places that have not been tagged, the coefficient will be 1. Other places will vary based on the tags in the range between 1 and 1.5.<br><br>

3. Counting coefficient
This coefficient can be increased by increasing the amount of sending and receiving, as well as by freezing the coloniume. During freezing, two factors of market fear and greed, as well as the total amount of frozen coloniume, affect the counting coefficient, so that if a person freezes coloniume when the market is frightened (FOG = 0) than the person that has frozen Coloniume when the market is greedy (FOG = 100) achieves three times in value. This makes the coloniume price chart to constantly profit and prevent heavy falls. This coefficient is increased by providing CPU and other items and these values are within etc.<br><br>
![Counting coefficient](images/007.jpg?raw=true "Counting coefficient")<br><br>
As one of the goals of Coloniume is the development of public, high quality and free Internet, the participation coefficient will directly seek to achieve this goal of Coloniume. In this way, the numerical value of this coefficient will be directly related to the amount of Internet distribution and sharing, the quality of the Internet, and the number of people covered by the Internet. In order to increase the participation rate, people must provide high quality internet to more people. (Internet quality is calculated based on the average provided). For example, if a person offers 1.5 times the average amount of Internet and Internet time to a person, that person will be counted as 1.5 people. In this case, Coloniume will continuously increase the quality and expand the scope of Internet access at the world level.<br><br>
![Participation factor](images/008.jpg?raw=true "Participation factor")<br><br>
To get the amount of reward awarded to each person, we obtain the above four coefficients based on the parameters and multiply them, that is, for each person, by multiplying these four coefficients, the person's score is obtained.<br>
Based on the following formula and according to the total points and the amount of coloniume release in the specified times, Coloniume reward system calculates the amount of coloniume assigned to each point and by multiplying it to the score of each person, calculates the amount of individuals' coloniume and send their reward.<br><br>
![Reward](images/009.jpg?raw=true "Reward")<br><br>
For network expansion and for sharing Internet, Storage, and CPU Coloniume tokens will be allocated to Nodes and Developers in the Coloniume with the algorithm of Proof of Power Resource Sharing (POPRS).<br><br>
For every 5 years, the number of released tokens will be reduced to half. This process will continue until the number of tokens reaches zero, which will take several hundred years.<br><br>
The rate of released token per minute during the first 5 years: 5000 units<br><br>
The Coloniume network will release 5000 Colonix currencies per minute. This amount will be fixed per minute and will be allocated to all network service providers according to their service.<br><br>
Coloniume network developers, called Blue Angel, will be able to increase their rewarding power by freezing a certain number of Coloniumes at specific addresses.<br><br>
Also, using artificial intelligence, the approximate value of each node that joins the network is calculated and displayed in the network status monitoring section. Thus, after joining millions of Nodes, the value of the network infrastructure reaches billions of dollars. Also the network by valuing each gigabyte that will be shared through the network calculates it through artificial intelligence at an average global rate and adds to the value of the network.<br>
The goal is to keep the true value of the coloniume network and the tokens generated as high as possible.<br><br>
Finally, the total value of the Coloniume network infrastructure is calculated and divided by the total number of tokens released to maintain the minimum basic price of each Coloniume unit.

## Who are Blue Angels?
As we believe, angels are redemptive and transcendental beings, and this is exactly the name of the blue angels. Blue is symbol of purity and peace, a symbol of communication and justice, leadership qualities and the ability to build teams, risk, solve problems and to inspire others. The main nature of angels is transcendence and joy, and the evolution of angels is done through the helping to evolution. Since angels are infinite non-physical beings, they can simultaneously help anyone who asks them for help and assist the poor people. But in the case of the blue angels of Coloniume, they are human beings of kindness and sense of duty and sense of helpfulness to their fellows and assistance of justice, knowledge and awareness in the world. Blue Angels are the soldiers and commanders who are hosting the flag of continuous internet connection, and the world and all the people of the world of the poorest child in the world to a lost person in the depths of the forest or a student and a scientist who are unable to pay the heavy cost of the internet ، can have access to the free internet in the coloniume platform. The Blue Angels are the heroes of themselves and the present world, to whom Coloniume bow their heads in respect to their will, thoughts and deeds, and the reward he receives from the Coloniume Foundation shows the degree of respect and gratitude that Coloniume has for these noble and honorable people and bannermen of progress and excellence.

### Work proof parameters for traffic server nodes:
1. The amount and volume of traffic shared per hour: The minimum time to calculate the reward and award it to each node will be one hour, after which the amount of reward will be calculated and will appeared in the person's account. The service provider should provide its sharing services for at least one hour to be rewarded)
2. One of the most effective factors in rewarding is the speed of connection and jitter of each Internet consumer with the Internet provider, which has a great impact on rewarding people. These values are calculated relative to the average, and individuals should perform better than the average for greater rewards
3. Increasing the quality of the Internet provided to the huge number of people can massively increase the reward of coloniume.
4. The percentage of frozen coloniumes and the index of fear and greed of the coloniume market within the counting coefficient increases the reward.
5. If a person turns off his internet earlier than an hour, he will not be rewarded. (This action will be taken to increase the quality of service.)
6. The algorithm is designed so that the priority of receiving rewards are with node linkers who have been online longer and have shared more data.
7. Participating and being in places that are tagged on the Coloniume website can provide a person with up to 1.5 more rewards.
8. In the next stages and in proportion to the launch of different phases and the addition of other capabilities to the network, such as sharing storage space or sharing the processing power of CPU servers based on the amount and type of service, node servers will be rewarded.
